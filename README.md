I challange my self to build python system to change string into number, i will open any suggestion or request for you to upgrade this program.

## Overview
This project is a Python program that converts numbers written in words into their numerical form. It can process a text file containing multiple lines of number words and output a converted file with their corresponding numerical values.

## Functions
- **words_to_number()**: Converts a single number in words into numerical format.
- **process_text_file()**: Reads a text file containing numbers in words, converts each line, and saves the results into a new file.

## Real-Life Benefits
This tool can be useful in various real-world applications, such as:
- Automating the conversion of financial documents that contain written numbers.
- Helping data entry professionals quickly digitize handwritten amounts.
- Assisting students and researchers in text-to-number conversion tasks.

## How It Works
1. The program reads a text file where each line contains a number written in words.
2. It processes each line by converting the words into numerical values.
3. The results are saved in a new file with "_converted" appended to the original filename.

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Save your numbers in words in a `.txt` file.

### Steps to Run
1. Run the Python script `Change-String-Into-Number.py`.
2. Enter the path to the text file when prompted.
3. The converted numbers will be saved in a new file in the same directory.

### Example
#### Input File (`numbers.txt`):
```
one hundred twenty three
four thousand five hundred sixty seven
nine million eight hundred seventy six thousand five hundred forty three
```
#### Output File (`numbers_converted.txt`):
```

4567
9876543
```

Now, your numbers in words are successfully converted into numerical values! ðŸš€
